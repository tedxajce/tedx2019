                        “Creative thinking inspires ideas. Ideas inspire change” - Barbara Januszkiewicz. TED is a nonprofit media organization devoted
                        to spreading ideas. It is a global community, welcoming people from every discipline and culture
                        who seek a deeper understanding of the world. The power of ideas can change attitudes, lives and
                        ultimately the world. Starting in 1984, TED Talks continue to be watched around the world, with an
                        average of 17 new page views a second. TED conferences and events continue to inspire, motivate and
                        thrill attendees.

                        TEDx are independent TED-like events, which can be organized by any inspiring and enthusiastic organizers with a license
                        from TED. TEDx was created in the spirit of TED's mission, 'ideas worth spreading'. It supports independent
                        organizers who want to create a TED-like event in their own community. It is designed to help communities,
                        organizations and individuals to spark conversation and connection through local TED-like experiences.
                        Here a screening of TED Talks videos — or a combination of live presenters and TED Talks videos —
                        sparks deep conversation and connections at the local level. TEDx has reached a checkpoint of 100,000
                        talks recently.
